## Sample apache configuration file for tendrl over https. Replace the
## placeholder in the VirtualHost tag with the correct IP.

## This configuration file assumes that mod_ssl package is installed on
## RHEL/CentOS hosts and it's configuration has not been modified.

<VirtualHost %ssl_virtualhost_ip%:443>
  # Adjust the ServerName directive to reflect the FQDN for your host. Add
  # additional ServerAlias directives if required.
  ServerName tendrl

  # This is where the tendrl frontend assets will be installed.
  DocumentRoot /var/www/tendrl

  # SSL Engine Switch:
  # Enable/Disable SSL for this virtual host.
  SSLEngine on

  # SSL Protocol support:
  # List the enable protocol levels with which clients will be able to
  # connect.  Disable SSLv2 access by default:
  SSLProtocol all -SSLv2

  # SSL Cipher Suite:
  # List the ciphers that the client is permitted to negotiate.
  # See the mod_ssl documentation for a complete list.
  SSLCipherSuite HIGH:MEDIUM:!aNULL:!MD5:!SEED:!IDEA

  # Server Certificate:
  # Point SSLCertificateFile at a PEM encoded certificate.  If
  # the certificate is encrypted, then you will be prompted for a
  # pass phrase.  Note that a kill -HUP will prompt again.  A new
  # certificate can be generated using the genkey(1) command.
  SSLCertificateFile /etc/pki/tls/certs/localhost.crt

  # Server Private Key:
  # If the key is not combined with the certificate, use this
  # directive to point at the key file.  Keep in mind that if
  # you've both a RSA and a DSA private key you can configure
  # both in parallel (to also allow the use of DSA ciphers, etc.)
  SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/pki/tls/private/localhost.key

  # Adjust the logging configuration as required.
  ErrorLog "logs/tendrl-error_log"

  # Per-Server Logging:
  # The home of a custom SSL log file. Use this when you want a
  # compact non-error SSL logfile on a virtual host basis.
  CustomLog logs/tendrl-ssl-access_log \
            "%t %h %{SSL_PROTOCOL}x %{SSL_CIPHER}x \"%r\" %b"

  # The requests to /api/ will all be forwarded to the tendrl-api application.
  ProxyPass "/api" http://127.0.0.1:9292/
  ProxyPassReverse "/api" http://127.0.0.1:9292/
