= Tendrl API

== Installation from Source on CentOS 7

NOTE: All the commands are run as a regular user that has `sudo` privileges.
The commands are all assumed to be run from a single directory, which by
default could be the user's home directory. If different, the required current
directory is indicated in `[]` before the shell prompt `$`.

=== Deployment Requirements

Ensure that etcd is running on a node in the network and is reachable from the
node you're about to install tendrl-api on. Note it's address and port. In most
development setups, both etcd and tendrl-api would reside on the same host.

=== System Setup

. Install the build toolchain.

 $ sudo yum groupinstall 'Development Tools'

. Install Ruby 2.0.0p598.

 $ sudo yum install ruby ruby-devel rubygem-bundler

=== Install tendrl-api

. Clone tendrl-api.

 $ git clone https://github.com/Tendrl/tendrl-api.git

. Install the gem dependencies, either..

 $ cd tendrl-api

.. everything,

 [tendrl-api] $ bundle install --path vendor/bundle --binstubs vendor/bin

.. OR development setup only,

 [tendrl-api] $ bundle install --path vendor/bundle --binstubs vendor/bin \
                --without production

.. OR production setup only.

 [tendrl-api] $ bundle install --path vendor/bundle --binstubs vendor/bin \
                --without development test documentation

NOTE: Using binstubs allows any of the executables to be executed directly from
`vendor/bin`, instead of via `bundle exec`.

=== Configuration

To configure the etcd connection information, copy the sample configuration
file to the appropriate location and make the necessary changes based on your
etcd configuration, as discussed in the <<_deployment_requirements,Deployment
Requirements>> section.

 [tendrl-api] $ cp config/etcd.sample.yml config/etcd.yml


== Development Environment

NOTE: All the commands below are assumed to be run from inside the git checkout
directory.

. Tendrl Definitions:
+
The API needs the proper Tendrl definitions yaml file to generate the
attributes and actions. You can either download it or use the one from the
fixtures to explore the API.

 [tendrl-api] $ cp spec/fixtures/sds/tendrl_definitions_gluster-3.8.3.yaml \
                config/sds/tendrl_definitions_gluster-3.8.3.yaml

. Seed the etcd instance (optional):
+
The script will seed the etcd instance with mock cluster data and print a
cluster uuid which can be used to make API requests.

 [tendrl-api] $ vendor/bin/rake etcd:seed # Seed the local store with cluster

. Start the development server:
+
This server will reload itself when any of the source files are updated.

 [tendrl-api] $ vendor/bin/shotgun
+
NOTE: This makes the development server to be queryable on `localhost:9393` by
default. Check `vendor/bin/shotgun --help` to change the ip:port binding.


== Test Environment

The test environment does not need the local etcd instance to run the tests.

 [tendrl-api] $ vendor/bin/rspec


== Running on Port 80

Binding to port 80 requires root permissions. However, tendrl-api runs as a
normal user. In order to make the application available on port 80, apache
needs to be installed and configured.

. Install apache

 $ sudo yum install httpd

. Copy over the sample configuration file and validate it's syntax.
+
IMPORTANT: Update the file for your specific host details. The file is
commented to point out the suggested changes. The file is configured to connect
to the tendrl-api application server on port 9292.
+
IMPORTANT: Running behind apache makes the API available at
`http://<hostname>:80/api/`. Client applications' (including tendrl frontend's)
configuration needs to be updated to make all API queries behind this endpoint.

 [tendrl-api] $ sudo cp config/apache.vhost.sample \
                /etc/httpd/conf.d/tendrl.conf
 $ sudo apachectl configtest

. Update the SELinux configuration to allow apache to make connections.

 $ sudo setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect 1

. Run the application via the production server `puma`, daemonised, listening
on port 9292.

 [tendrl-api] $ vendor/bin/puma -e development -d
+
NOTE: It is possible to run both the development and the production servers at
the same time, with the production server behind apache. While the production
server `puma` runs, by default, on port 9292; the development server `shotgun`
listens on port 9393.

. Start apache.

 $ sudo systemctl start httpd.service
